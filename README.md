# Immunization Tracker
## ROLE: Web UI Developer (Eric SarragaLugo)

This project was built using HTML, SASS, and Javascript.

The only dependency to work on this part of the project is to have the SASS preprocessor installed and properly working in your dev environment. Once you install Sass you can open your terminal navigate to the project directory and run `sass --no-source-map --watch sass/:css/` in order to have sass update the required files as needed. 

The `index.sass` file is used to concatenate all of the styling files in the correct order and output them into the `./css/` directory for use by the HTML files. The rest of the sass files are built as partials to ensure only one file is output.

There currently isn't an extreme amount of JavaScript for the marketing site so it was kept in one file `index.js` in order to not fetch multiple files when loading.

Currently you will find a few extra files in the base project directory. These are from HTML5 Boilerplate and have, as of yet, not been tweaked. although my goal is to eventually go back and even tackle making custom icons for this project. (We'll see about that...)

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Hope you enjoy looking through my project.
