          ImmuTrack saved out wedding plans! A couple of weeks before the wedding, as we were finalizing our honeymoon itinerary we realized that we had to gather the medical documentation necessary for our travel visas. We had no time to spare and thanks to ImmuTrack we were able to make our dreams
          a reality. Can’t wait to use it with our child soon!

        <p>
          ImmuTrack has taken so much stress out of these first few months. A few weeks before our baby was due I was stressing over how to know when my baby needed shots and which ones they would need. In comes ImmuTrack like a superhero! When I discovered this service I wasn’t sure, but now I
          can’t imagine trying to handle all of this info without it.

        <p>
          We’ve been using ImmuTrack for just over a year and it has fundamentally changed the way our practice handles vaccinations. By using ImmuTrack we can make sure our customers have all of the information they want ahead of time. And don’t even get me started on moves! Before it was such a
          hassle trying to make sure patient records were delivered correctly. Now it just takes a few taps and BAM!
